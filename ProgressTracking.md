# Progress Tracking

In this file I plan to write updates for what I'm working on with steno.

This would include the following:

- Why I'm adding the dictionary entries, and how they help my workflow
- Development of Plover plugins
- Ah-ha moments or awesome discoveries
- Number of dictionary entries added
- Possibly WPM progress (I'm not too worried about this)

## 2022-04-22

- Made progress with my fork of [steno mouse](https://github.com/derekthecool/plover-mouse),
  this let's me have very
  quick mouse control while using steno! At first I thought it could not support
  multiple monitors, but if you just put in percents higher than 100 you can
  jump to next monitor!
- Added some neovim mappings for debugging that use Emily-symbols. I'm using
  multiples of '\_', which is not really even possible to input ** versus \_**
  every time.
