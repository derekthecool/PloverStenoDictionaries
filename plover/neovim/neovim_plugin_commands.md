# Neovim Plugin Commands

This dictionary is meant to be exclusively for neovim plugin commands and
mappings. I will organize it similar to how I have it mapped in my neovim
configuration, and that is by [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim)
groupings.

which-key is a plugin that helps you remember your mappings. I use `,` as my
neovim leader key and so most of these commands start with `,`.
